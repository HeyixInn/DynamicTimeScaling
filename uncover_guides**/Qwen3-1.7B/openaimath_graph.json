This helps prevent issues when the file is not in the expected location. Always include a check for the file's existence before reading it. For example, you can add `os.path.exists('data.csv')` to confirm the file is present. This ensures the code runs smoothly without exceptions. Additionally, after loading the data, it's a good practice to print a summary of the data to understand its structure and ensure there are no missing values or outliers that need handling. This proactive step helps catch potential issues early in the modeling process. Regularly reviewing the data's integrity is crucial for accurate model training and evaluation. By following these steps, you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure your model is robust and reliable. ": 1.1447747828930062
