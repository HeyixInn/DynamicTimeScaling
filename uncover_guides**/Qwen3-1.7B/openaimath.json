Additionally, after loading the data, it's a good practice to print a summary of the data to understand its structure and ensure there are no missing values or outliers that need handling. This proactive step helps catch potential issues early in the modeling process. Regularly reviewing the data's integrity is crucial for accurate model training and evaluation.
